# Campaign_Spending_Rematch_Elections

The relationship between campaign spending and votes received is the subject of widespread research and speculation. In the two years leading up to the 2018 elections, congressional campaigns spent over 1.13 billion dollars. Another $3.29 billion dollars was spent by political parties and PACs. Many powerful people would likely spend large quantities of money if only we could accurately measure the impact of these expenditures. 
 
Alas, elections are complex. It is difficult to even identify all of the influencing factors that contribute to election results, let alone quantify said factors. To name a few: 

* VOTER TURNOUT
* CANDIDATE APPEAL
* PARTY AFFILIATION
* WORLD AFFAIRS
* ECONOMY
* INCUMBENT, CHALLENGER, OR OPEN SEAT?
* STATE & DISTRICT

And yet, we're talking about $4+ billion dollars, so we should probably be able to detect a difference(?).

Keeping in mind all of the factors 
I use Stanford's Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME). This is a comprehensive collection that combines campaign finance data, election results, and other relevant information.

An exploratory analysis of relationships between campaign finance trends and election results for U.S. congressional elections

Initial questions:

General question: Whatâ€™s up with the correlation between money spent and votes earned (with candidates as control)? Is there a correlation between between money spent and votes received ? Is there a stronger correlation for the House than for the Senate? Is there a stronger correlation for one party versus other(s)? Is there a stronger correlation in some states than others?

General question: What are the (some) geographical trends in campaign spending? (candidates not used as control?) Do some states consistently spend more per candidate than others? Do some states have consistently higher ratios of votes per dollar spent?

General question: How have campaign finance trends changed over time? How has average money spent per candidate changed over time? How have donation trends changed over time?
